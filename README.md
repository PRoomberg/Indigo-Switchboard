# What is the Switchboard Plugin?

Switchboard is an evolutionary replacement of the Indigo Security Script.

The name change is due to the show the difference in the product.  Switchboard monitors the other devices, and dispatches new commands as needed.

The previous “generation” of security script had a much more limited ability to monitor devices, it could only monitor Security sensors (e.g. DS10A, Big Red Button, Triggerlincs, etc).

Switchboard changes this.  It treats all devices the same, so you can monitor non-security devices, as well security devices…  This allows you to simply to monitor your door sensors, as with the v4 Security Script, but now you can also monitor your bedroom lights, or anything else in Indigo’s database.

Yes, some of this can already be done in Indigo by making a trigger action…  But Switchboard goes beyond this functionality.

# What does Switchboard add to Indigo?
